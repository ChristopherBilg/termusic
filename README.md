# Terminal Music Player written in Rust

Nowadays listen to favorite songs are not easy. For online services, the copyrights
are owned by several different softwares and websites. Local player becomes the best choice.

As a contributor of GOMU(https://github.com/issadarkthing/gomu), I met serious problems during 
development. The main problem is data race condition. So I basically rewrite the player in rust, 
and hope to solve the problem.

As for now, mp3, m4a, flac and ogg/vorbis are supported.
